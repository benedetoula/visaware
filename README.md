### Wiki

To get to the wiki, open the repository home page in your browser and hit the Wiki tab.

We use the wiki as a place for freely communicating ideas and supporting materials for the project. Note that version control is on everywhere *but* the wiki - when you modify a wiki entry, no record is kept of past versions.
