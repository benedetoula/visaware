### Wiki

We use the wiki as an informal place for freely communicating ideas and supporting materials for the project. Note that version control is on everywhere **except** the wiki - when you modify a wiki entry, no record of it is kept of past versions.

To get to the wiki, open the repository home page in your browser and hit the Wiki tab.

So if there's anything we save here for which we want to keep version history, do not put it in the Wiki but instead save a file you create anywhere in the repository.
